* [Recursion in MIPS](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~ewang/cs260/ln/2.3_Recursion_factorial_fibonacci.pdf)
* Getting ModelSim set up: ([guide](../ece154a/modelsim_154a) up to date in 2021)

* [MIPS v4 ISA reference](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f97/public/doc/mips-isa.pdf)
  This is much more in-depth than the green sheet, and useful if something isn't making sense in a program/design.

* [Verilog 2005 Language Spec](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~songch/download/IEEE.1364-2005.pdf) (in depth, useful for answering questions about really weird behavior)
