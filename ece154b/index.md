### Devices and Modeling
* [Great slides on behavior/timing of memory](https://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/s2004/LECTURES/l7.pdf)

### ISAs and Pipelining
* ["Core MIPS" instruction table (sometimes easier to parse than Green Sheet)](https://mipsconverter.com/opcodes.html)
* [Script to assemble very simple MIPS programs](https://github.com/dagmawim/mips-converter)
* [Recursion in MIPS](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~ewang/cs260/ln/2.3_Recursion_factorial_fibonacci.pdf)
* Getting ModelSim set up: ([guide](../ece154a/modelsim_154a) up to date in 2021)
* [My 154a materials](../ece154a)
* [MIPS v4 ISA reference](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f97/public/doc/mips-isa.pdf)
  This is much more in-depth than the green sheet, and useful if something isn't making sense in a program/design.
* ["The Case for the RISC", Patterson & Ditzel, 1980](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/641914.641917)

### Hardware Description
* ["Compact" Verilog reference](https://ee.sharif.edu/~logic_circuits_t/readings/The%20Verilog%20Golden%20Reference%20Guide%20by%20DOULOS.pdf)
* [Verilog 2005 Language Spec](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~songch/download/IEEE.1364-2005.pdf) (in depth, useful for answering questions about really weird behavior)
* [What's actually contained in `always @(*)`?](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs150/Documents/Always.pdf)
* [Verilog for Delay Modeling](static/CummingsHDLCON1999_BehavioralDelays_Rev1_1.pdf)

### Branch Predictors
